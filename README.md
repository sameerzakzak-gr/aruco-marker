# Aruco Marker for Edge Detection

This project implements **Aruco markers** to detect and analyze edges in an image or video feed.  
The Aruco marker acts as a reference point to improve accuracy in edge detection.

## Features
- Uses OpenCV for image processing and Aruco marker detection.
- Applies edge detection algorithms such as Canny and Sobel.
- Can be used for object tracking, measurement, and AR applications.

## Installation
**Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aruco-edge-detection.git
    cd aruco-edge-detection
    ```
**Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```
## Usage
**Run the detection script:**
    ```sh
    python detect_edges.py
    ```
